# sonar-rock-vs-mine-classification
This project implements a binary classification machine learning model that predicts whether an object detected by SONAR is a Rock or a Mine based on 60 signal features. The model is trained using Logistic Regression, a supervised learning algorithm suitable for linearly separable classification problems.
